## 📌 JavaScript Function

### What is it?
A **JavaScript function** is a block of code used to:
- Perform logic
- Calculate values
- Reuse functionality

### Example
```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
```

### 📌 React Component

### What is it?

A **React component** is a special JavaScript function that:

- Returns JSX (UI)

- Builds the user interface

- Uses React features like props and state

### Example
```js
function Button() {
  return <button>Click Me</button>;
}

export default Button;
```
