## 📌 What is a Component in React?

A **component** in React is a **JavaScript function** that returns UI (written using JSX).

React applications are built by combining multiple small components together.

## Why Use Components?

- ♻️ **Reusable** – write once, use multiple times  
- 🧹 **Clean code** – easier to read and manage  
- 🛠 **Easy maintenance** – changes reflect everywhere  
- 🧠 **Better structure** – UI is divided into small parts

## 🧪 Example: Simple Component

### `Hello.jsx`
```jsx
function Hello() {
  return <h1>Hello React</h1>;
}

export default Hello;
