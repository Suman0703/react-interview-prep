# Difference Between Library and Framework
---

## 📌 What is a Library?

A library is a collection of pre-written code that provides specific functionality.
When using a library, you control the application flow; you decide when and where to use the library’s code.

Example:
jQuery is a library. You call its functions whenever you need to manipulate the DOM, handle events, etc.

### Key Points:
- You call the library when you need it
- More flexibility
- No fixed structure
- Focused on solving specific problems

### Examples:
- React
- Lodash
- Axios

## 📌 What is a Framework?

A framework is a larger structure or “skeleton” for building applications, with built-in patterns, libraries, and rules that developers follow.
When using a framework, it often controls the flow of the application and decides when to call your code. This concept is known as Inversion of Control.

Example:
React, Angular, and Django are frameworks. They provide a structured approach, and your code “plugs into” their workflow.

### Key Points:
- Framework calls your code
- Less flexibility, more rules
- Fixed structure
- Handles application flow

### Examples:
- Angular
- Django
- Spring Boot
