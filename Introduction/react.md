# Difference Between Library and Framework
---

## 📌 What is a Library?

A **library** is a collection of reusable functions or tools that help you perform
specific tasks.  
You are **in control of the flow** of the application and decide **when and where**
to use the library.

### Key Points:
- You call the library when you need it
- More flexibility
- No fixed structure
- Focused on solving specific problems

### Examples:
- React
- Lodash
- Axios

## 📌 What is a Framework?

A **framework** provides a complete structure for building applications.  
It controls the flow of the application and **calls your code** when required.

This concept is known as **Inversion of Control**.

### Key Points:
- Framework calls your code
- Less flexibility, more rules
- Fixed structure
- Handles application flow

### Examples:
- Angular
- Django
- Spring Boot
