# 📦 Dependencies and DevDependencies Explained

## 📌 What is `package.json`?

`package.json` is a configuration file used in JavaScript projects.
It tells npm:
- which libraries the project needs
- how the project should run

Both `dependencies` and `devDependencies` are defined inside this file.

## 🔹 dependencies

`dependencies` are libraries that your application **needs to run**.

If these libraries are missing, the application will **not work**.

### 📦 Example
```json
"dependencies": {
  "react": "^18.2.0",
  "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
  "axios": "^1.6.0"
}
```

## 🔹 dependencies

`devDependencies` are libraries that are only needed during development.

They help developers build, test, and maintain the application, but are
not required after deployment.

### 📦 Example
```json
"devDependencies": {
  "vite": "^5.0.0",
  "eslint": "^8.0.0"
}

```
